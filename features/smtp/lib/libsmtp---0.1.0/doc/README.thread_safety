libsmtp-- and thread safety
===========================

libsmtp-- is not thread safe, nor will it be ever be. 

libsmtp-- is designed for simplicity, design and ease of use. It 
is not meant to be used in any high loaded production software 
like email servers (of course), but it is meant to be useful if you 
want to add SMTP features to your software or if you are writing 
some sort of email client. In such a software project the libsmtp--
functions are not excessively called, exactly then when you want to
send an email message, and so there will be no big performance loss
if you syncronize your threads when you use the libsmtp-- functions.

If you have a good reason why to make libsmtp-- nevertheless thread 
safe, do not hesitate to message me. Maybe you can convince me :-)
