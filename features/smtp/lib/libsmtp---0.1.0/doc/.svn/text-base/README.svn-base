libsmtp-- version 0.1

Preface
=======

libsmtp-- is a library that implements the client part of the SMTP
protocol. libsmtp-- is a rewrite in C of libsmtp++, which is written
in C++. The main reason was the enormous size of the C++ library - 
about 500k. libsmtp++ will be maintained in addition in the future, 
but it will become a wrapper around libsmtp--.

libsmtp-- should be easy to integrate and at the same time it should
provide all the SMTP features that are of importance.

Currently the following features are implemented:
CRAM-MD5   authentication
CRAM-SHA1  authentication [untested]
LOGIN      authentication
PLAIN      authentication
ANONYMOUS  authentication
EXTERNAL   authentication [untested]
STARTTLS   ssl encryption
SMTPS      ssl encryption

The following features will be implemented in later releases:
NTLM        [Microsoft]
SKEY
DIGEST-MD5
DIGEST-SHA1
(both are a bit difficult to implement in contrast to the CRAM-*
methods)


History
=======

libsmtp++ was part of pushmail [1]. Sometime i realized that the SMTP
part of pushmail was well designed enough to be outsourced into
a library, so that maybe someone else will benefit from it.
Then i realized that the C++ object was too big, so i started to
rewrite libsmtp++ in C, and libsmtp-- was born.

That's it:-)


Documentation
=============

Currently you will find a step by step guide in the directory
doc/examples.


Warning
=======

This library is in the process of being developed. I will try to make
the library as good and clean as possible, but by no means i will 
preserve the interface from one unstable minor version to the next if
i see some way to improve the interface. That means, that the interface
from one unstable libsmtp-- release to the other (all uneven releases, 
for example 0.1.0 to 0.1.1) may change.

However, once a stable state is reached, indicated by an even release
number (0.2, 0.4 etc), you can be sure that the interface will not 
change anymore (for example from 0.2.0 to 0.2.1 the interface will
stay the same, but the 0.4.0 interface will be, of course, different).


Requirements
============

You will need the openssl [2] library and the openssl headers
to compile libsmtp--.
